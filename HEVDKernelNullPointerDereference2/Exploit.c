// Q: What is the difference between this exploit and the other null pointer dereference exploit in the GitHub repository?
// A: This exploit will be written WITHOUT referencing any writeups for the null pointer dereference vulnerability.
// In addition, I will link the sources that I may use throughout to figure out a problem.
